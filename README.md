# International-Portal-APDS-

Assignment Topic:
You work as a developer in the internal development team for an international bank. Your team is 
working on the internal international payment system. Customers often must make international 
payments via the bank’s online banking site. From here, the payments need to be displayed on the 
payments portal only accessible by dedicated pre-registered staff. Customers need to register for 
the system by providing their full name, ID number, account number, and password. As you can 
imagine, this is quite sensitive information that needs to be appropriately secured. After registering, 
customers need to log on to the website by providing their username, account number and 
password. Once logged on, the customer should be able to enter the amount they need to pay, 
choose the relevant currency and choose a provider to make the payment. In South Africa, we 
mainly make use of SWIFT. They will next be prompted for the account information and SWIFT code 
for which they wish the payment to be made. The customer will finalise their process by clicking on 
Pay Now. 
From here, the transaction should be stored in a secured database and appear on the international 
payments portal. Employees of the bank are pre-registered on the portal when they are employed. 
No registration is necessary; however, they do need to log on to the system to check transactions 
and forward them to SWIFT for payment. This is done by checking the payee's account information 
and verifying that the SWIFT code is correct. The employees complete the transaction by clicking a 
verified button next to each entry and finally by clicking submit to SWIFT – your job ends when that 
button is clicked.
